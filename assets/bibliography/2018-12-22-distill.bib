abstract = {The widespread creative application and smart devices call for convenient and secure interaction with human users. We propose, design, and implement a smartwatch-based two-factor real-time identification and authentication system named ThumbUp, where smartwatch users can identify and authenticate themselves by some simple hand and finger gestures, such as thumb-up. ThumbUp leverages the signal collected from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smart devices and discovers the unique fingerprint pattern produced by each user&amp;#x2019;s simple hand gestures using a carefully crafted deep learning model. We implement our system and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its efficacy and efficiency with 65 different users over a period of more than 3 months. It reaches an accuracy of 97% for identification, and EER 0.014 for authentication using only one simple gesture. We also survey the users&amp;#x2019; acceptance of our system and discuss how the proficiency of gestures affects authentication accuracy.},
