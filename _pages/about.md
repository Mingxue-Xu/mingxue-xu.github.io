Hi there:D

I am a third-year PhD at Imperial College London, luckily supervised by [Prof. Danilo P. MandiÄ‡](https://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~mandic/index.htm). My research direction is <u>Deep Learning Model Compression based on Tensor Decomposition (Low-rank Factorization)</u>, with a current focus on language models.

Previously, I obtained my BEng at China University of Petroleum - Beijing. My MEng was at University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiang-Yang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JURtNb0AAAAJ&hl=en). Both my BEng and MEng are in Computer Science and Technology. Also I did an internship at [Baidu PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
